Hi friend!
Yes I saw that crashed ship!
I can guide you but I need help myself.
I lost my scarf the other day.
I think it was next to some rocks...
Maybe you can give me a hand and find it?
Thanks, be quick!

//PNJ 1.2 (run 2)
Thank you, you found it!
This is a precious scarf.
I have another request if you don't mind.
After that, I swear I'll tell you where the starship is.
Wild Gnoupos are hiding in our fields.
Could you please make them run away?

Oh! I've almost forgotten to give you the battery.
Without you can't do it.

Hi!
I am late for an important meeting.
But I left my ritual knive at home.
Could you please bring it back to me?
I know you are looking for a space ship...
And I know its exact location.
